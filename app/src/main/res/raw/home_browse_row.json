We know of the Korean Provisional Government, but we don’t know of Jeong Jeonghwa who took care of things inside Korea. We are unfamiliar with their names, but they were female independence activists who really existed. Just because their achievements weren’t recognized and they went different paths, they are being forgotten. This drama depicts the traces of these women. Cast: Kim Sohye, Oh Seungyoon",
